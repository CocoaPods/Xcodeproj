# Xcodeproj

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj)

Xcodeproj lets you create and modify Xcode projects from [Ruby][ruby].
Script boring management tasks or build Xcode-friendly libraries. Also includes
support for Xcode workspaces (.xcworkspace) and configuration files (.xcconfig).

It is used in [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) to create a
static library from scratch, for both iOS and OSX.

The documentation can be found [here](http://docs.cocoapods.org/xcodeproj/index.html).

## Installing Xcodeproj

Xcodeproj itself installs through RubyGems, the Ruby package manager. Install it
by performing the following command:

    $ [sudo] gem install xcodeproj


## Colaborate

All Xcodeproj development happens on [GitHub][xcodeproj]. Contributing patches
is really easy and gratifying. You even get push access when one of your patches
is accepted.
