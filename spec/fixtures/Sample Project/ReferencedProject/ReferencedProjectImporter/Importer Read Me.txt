// Core Data Application Spotlight Importer
//==============================================================================

Spotlight importers should be provided by all applications that support custom 
document formats. A Spotlight importer parses your document format for relevant 
information and assigning that information to the appropriate metadata keys.

The bundle target in this project creates a Spotlight importer bundle installed 
inside of the wrapper of the application target.  This bundle includes all of 
the code necessary to import two types of information into Spotlight:

1) The metadata information from Core Data stores.

The only default metadata for a Core Data store is the store ID and store type,
neither of which is imported.  To have metadata from your stores imported, you
must first add the information you are interested to the metadata for your 
store (see the NSPersistentStoreCoordinator setMetadataForPersistentStore: API)
and then pull the information for import in the GetMetadataForFile function in
the 'GetMetadataForFile.c' file.

2) Instance Level indexing information

    For each instance of an entity that contains properties indexed by Spotlight 
(defined in your Core Data Model), the importer will extract the values. This
extraction is done in MySpotlightImporter.m

Additionally, the importer must contain a list of the Uniform Type Identifiers
(UTI) for your application in order to import the data.  (The UTI information is
used by Spotlight to know which importer to invoke for a given file.)  If the
UTI is not already registered by your application, you will need to register it
in the importer bundle.  (For more information on registering UTIs for
applications, consult the documentation at http://developer.apple.com)
